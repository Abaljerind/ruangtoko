# RuangToko – Modern E-commerce UI (Frontend Only)

This is a solution to the **RuangToko** project — a modern and responsive e-commerce UI built to practice real-world application flow using React. The goal of this project is to simulate a modern shopping experience with dynamic UI interaction, cart system, search & filter, and clean component architecture.
